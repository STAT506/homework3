#### Q1. (10 points)

This question will focus on sample size characteristics for a simple regression model with no intercept and a single continuous covariate. Create a Shiny app that allows users to input:

- a slope coefficient (beta1),
- variance in the data (sigmasq), and
- range of sample size.

The app should return a figure of standard error of beta1 against the specified range of possible sample sizes.

You are welcome to embed this in an .RMD file or just create shiny app from an R script. Only the source code needs to be submitted.
