#### Q1. (10 points)

This question will focus on sample size characteristics for a simple regression model with no intercept and a single continuous covariate. Create a Shiny app that allows users to input:

- a slope coefficient (beta1) and
- variance in the data (sigmasq)
- range of x (optional)

The app should return a figure of standard error of beta1 against sample size.

You are welcome to embed this in an .RMD file or just create shiny app from an R script. Only the source code needs to be submitted.
